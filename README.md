## Run the react project
With a terminal: 
* `cd frontend`
* `npm i` to install/update all dependencies 
* `npm run dev`, and then open the corresponding localhost in a browser, like [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
* use `ctrl+C` to stop. If you make some changes to react files, the changes will be reflected in the browser immediately without the need to restart.

## Run the server
Currently the server does nothing and it not needed to run the react project, but you can run it anyway.

With a terminal: 
* `cd backend`
* `npm i` to install/update all dependencies 
* `node server.js` to run the server
* use `ctrl+C` to stop. If you make some changes to server files, you need to stop and restart the server to see changes.
